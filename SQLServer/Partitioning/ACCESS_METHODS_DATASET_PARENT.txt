NB: LATCH_EX on ACCESS_METHODS_DATASET_PARENT is not about IO at all. It is strictly related to parallelism, 
as is the latch the parallel scans 'child' threads must acquire on the parent thread to allocate the scan range for that child. 
Contention on it indicates the parallelism is inefficient (is doing more 'homework' than actual useful work). 

Partitioning would exacerbate this symptom, specially unaligned partitioning (as parent/child datasets are set per partition). 

Bad cardinality estimates (outdated stats?) may also be to blame, conducting to parallelism when not necessary. 
On and all my advice is the same: identify the actual problem query(s).
